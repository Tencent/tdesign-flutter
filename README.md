Tencent TDesign UI component library of Flutter, suitable for use in mobile projects.


# ðŸŽ‰ Features

- Provides Flutter UI component library in TDesign design style
- Support customizing themes according to App design style
- Provides commonly used Icon library and supports customized replacement
- Define color groups according to the TDesign specification, which can be viewed in TDColors to facilitate the adaptation of components to the TDesign specification.
- The color value declaration class can add default colors and view the default display effect of color values in real time.


# ðŸ”¨ Usage
- SDK dependency version
```yaml
dart: ">=2.19.0 <4.0.0"
flutter: ">=3.7.0"
```

- Add the dependency in `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  tdesign_flutter: ^0.0.6
```

- Import at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:tdesign_flutter/tdesign_flutter.dart';
```

- You can configure theme styles such as colors, font sizes, font styles, corner radius, and shadows through a json file. 
Retrieve theme data using `TDTheme.of(context)` or `TDTheme.defaultData()`. It is recommended 
that components use `TDTheme.of(context)` unless the component does not need to follow local themes, 
in which case `TDTheme.defaultData()` can be used.

Examples of using colors, fonts, and corner radius:

```dart
TDTheme.of(context).brandNormalColor
TDTheme.defaultData().fontBodyLarge
```

- TDesign's icons do not follow the theme, they are all in ttf format, usage examples:

```dart
Icon(TDIcons.activity)
```

- For more use examples, please refer to [example/lib/page](tdesign-component/example/lib/page)
