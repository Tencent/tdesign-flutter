Tencent TDesign UI component library of Flutter, suitable for use in mobile projects. 


[中文文档](https://github.com/Tencent/tdesign-flutter/blob/main/tdesign-component/README_zh.md)


# Features:

- Provides Flutter UI component library in TDesign design style
- Support customizing themes according to App design style
- Provides commonly used Icon library and supports customized replacement
- Define color groups according to the TDesign specification, which can be viewed in TDColors to facilitate the adaptation of components to the TDesign specification.
- The color value declaration class can add default colors and view the default display effect of color values in real time.


# Notice:

- Theme styles such as color/font size/font style/rounded corners/shadow can be configured through json files. Get theme data through `TDTheme.of(context)` or `TDTheme.defaultData()`. It is recommended that all components use `TDTheme.of(context)`Only components that do not need to follow the local theme can use `TDTheme.defaultData()`.

  Examples of usage of colors, fonts, rounded corners, etc.:
```
    TDTheme.of(context).brandNormalColor
    TDTheme.defaultData().fontBodyLarge
```

- TDesign's icons do not follow the theme, they are all in ttf format, usage examples:
```
    Icon(TDIcons.activity)
```
    
- Example: `example/lib/page/`
